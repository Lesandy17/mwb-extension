# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** 08/06/2025

**By installing or using Osprey, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.**

Osprey is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our browser extension operates and how
we handle your data.

## Data Collection and Use

Osprey does not collect or store any personal data from its users. We do not have access to your browsing history or any
other data that can personally identify you.

## URL Checking

When you navigate to a website, Osprey may send the stripped-down version of the URL (i.e., domain and path, excluding
tracking parameters) to third-party threat intelligence or DNS filtering providers listed in the
project's [README.md](https://github.com/Foulest/Osprey/blob/main/README.md). These requests are made solely to
determine whether the destination is considered malicious or inappropriate. Osprey does not store these requests or
associate them with your identity.

## Third-Party Services

The third-party services listed in the project's [README.md](https://github.com/Foulest/Osprey/blob/main/README.md)
file may have their own privacy policies regarding the information they collect and how they use it. We encourage you
to review their privacy policies for more information.

If you enable DNS-based filtering features, your DNS queries may be sent directly to the selected provider. These
services operate independently of Osprey and may log or process DNS requests according to their own terms and policies.

## User Liability

Some providers may require a valid license or API key. Although those options might be enabled by default, if you enable
any integration, you must ensure you have the right to do so. Osprey makes no guarantee that enabling an integration
complies with the provider's Terms of Service. You are responsible for ensuring that your use of any third-party
service, including DNS or API-based threat detection, complies with that service's terms, licenses, or rate limits.

Any legal, financial, or technical issues arising from unauthorized use, such as service suspension, inaccurate threat
data, or TOS violations, are solely your responsibility. Osprey is provided "as-is." We are not liable for
interruptions, errors, or claims resulting from unauthorized API calls. Use third-party services at your own risk. You
agree to hold Osprey and its maintainers harmless from any claims, damages, or costs related to enabling or using
integrations you are not licensed to use.

## Browser Permissions

Osprey requires certain browser permissions to function, such as access to page URLs and the ability to modify DNS
settings. These permissions are used strictly to provide security features and are not used to collect or transmit
personal information. The extension operates locally and does not connect to a central Osprey server.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We reserve the right to update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the
new Privacy Policy on this page with a new effective date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically
for any updates.

**By continuing to use Osprey after any changes are posted, you agree to the updated Privacy Policy.**
