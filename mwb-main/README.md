## Our Mission

Our mission is simple: become the most trusted, transparent, and effective browser protection extension for home users
and businesses by empowering open-source intelligence to combat malware, phishing, and scams across the globe with our
partners. The best protection is free protection, and building a privacy-first, open-source tool that IT teams, security
researchers, and end-users can trust to secure their browsing, wherever they go, is the best way to provide it.

Osprey is committed to being non-profit, non-commercial, and open-source, **forever**, with no plans to monetize the
project in any way.
Unlike other free browser extensions, Osprey doesn't collect, profile,
and [sell your browsing data](https://ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/02/ftc-order-will-ban-avast-selling-browsing-data-advertising-purposes-require-it-pay-165-million-over/?utm_source=osprey)
behind your back. We're fully GDPR-compliant and committed to being as transparent as possible. We don't use centralized
servers or user accounts to protect your devices. Osprey runs locally on your device, offline or online, with zero
telemetry or back-end analytics. Check out our [Privacy Policy here](https://osprey.ac/privacy) for more info.

The more protection providers join the project, the better the Osprey threat intelligence platform becomes. If you're
interested in improving global threat intelligence and want to join the project, feel free to get in contact with me
at **support@osprey.ac** or via Osprey's [LinkedIn Page](https://osprey.ac/linkedin).

## Warning

If the website is malicious, Osprey will block the page and display a warning:

![Osprey Warning](https://i.imgur.com/ZmVOFfU.png)

From this page, you can report the website as safe, always ignore the website, go back to safety, and continue
anyway. By default, Osprey creates a browser notification for blocked pages that
[you can toggle on and off](https://github.com/Foulest/Osprey/wiki/Toggling-Notifications) using the context menu.
You can hide the continue and report buttons, lock down the protection options, and even hide the context menu
entirely using [the system policies](https://github.com/Foulest/Osprey/wiki/Setting-Up-System-Policies).

## Settings

You can configure the extension's protection options in the settings:

![Osprey Settings (Page 1)](https://i.imgur.com/gHnrfHN.png)
![Osprey Settings (Page 2)](https://i.imgur.com/mNyYkFR.png)

If you're unsure about the functions of each protection provider, **it's best to keep the default settings.**

You can restore them by right-clicking the extension icon and selecting **Restore default settings**.

- [ ] [DNS4EU Family DNS](https://joindns4.eu/for-public/?utm_source=osprey)

Providers disabled by default are either due to:

- Frequent reports of false positives
- Failure to respond to false positive reports
- Being an optional adult content filter
- Being a paid service that requires a license or API key

If a provider gives you false positives, report the links to them directly and disable them in the Protection Options
panel if needed. Osprey is designed to be customizable, so you can enable or disable any of the providers at any time.
Osprey does not have control over the providers' databases or how they classify URLs.
